# Terminal Sorting Visualizer

A Display of Sorting Algorithm Bar Graphs written in C# and based in the Terminal

Sorts Included:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort

The project simulates the sorting of a random set of data through each algorithm, and it allows for the speeding and slowing down of each algorithm with the + and - keys, as well as switching in between algorithms with the <- and -> keys.

It should be noted that as of right now, the project does not simulate the speed of each algorithm, but instead each individual step that is taken. So simple algorithms with little actual swaps like Selection and Insertion Sort will seem to take less time than more complex algorithms like Merge and Quick sort. Bubble Sort still takes forever like always though.
